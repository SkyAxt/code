This is a project that I created while attending UCI - after learning about recursions. 
The goal is to create a program that requests for specific user inputs 
that feeds into a file directory and search for a unique characteristics of the file. 
These characteristics are file extension, memory size, certain strings of a file name.



What I learned: 
Decorators
Recursion
Clean Functional Programming
