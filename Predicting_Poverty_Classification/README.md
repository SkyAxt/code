This started as a final project for a beginner's course to Machine Learning. 
The project consisted of utilizing R packages to create visualizations and prediction. 
The goal of the project was to predict classify if an observation was poor or not. 
The train and test data sets were censored in this old Kaggle Competition.
For this binary classfication problem, in R used decision trees, random forest classification, logit & probit regression. 
However, for the final project, I utilized the base model and did not use any specific methodologies in tuning the 
hyperparameters, or use any validation techniques. These predictive models are very naive and are extremely overfitted 
but for the purpose of the class, it served well in introducing these concepts.

As of right now, I am working on the project in python in hoping to use more advance methodologies
and tuning their hyperparameters to acheive a respectful logloss score while also not overfitting.
