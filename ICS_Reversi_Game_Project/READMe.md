This is the final project for an intemediate Python course at UCI. 
It is a player vs player digital version of the famous board game Othello.
The project is divided into two parts, first build the game logic then create the
graphical interface. The game has the option to have a board with 4x4 tiles and up 16x16. 
The goal was to build a game frame that applies strings/texts and then utilizes those same
logic to add Graphical user interface.
